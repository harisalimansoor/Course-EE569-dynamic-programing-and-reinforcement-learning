# Dynamic Programing and Reinforcement Learning
This repo contain code of assignmetns for the course dynamic programic and reinfrcement learning, that is offered at Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS). EE569 Dynamic Programming and Reinforcement Learning: Dynamic programming is a framework for deriving optimal decision strategies in evolving and uncertain environments. In the first part of the course, we will cover the theoretical foundations of dynamic programming in detail. Topics include the principle of optimality in deterministic and stochastic settings, LQR control, value and policy iteration. In the second part of the course, we will focus on approximation techniques and simulation-based methods such as online reinforcement learning, approximate dynamic programming, and model predictive control.
